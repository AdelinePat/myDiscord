    Transmission Control Protocol/Internet Protocol (TCP/IP),

    Winsock allows Windows programs and applications to connect to the internet through TCP/IP.
    Winsock exists as a data link layer, and is also known as winsock.dll in our computers.
    
    Winsock serves as a translator for basic network services, such as send () or receive () requests.*/
